## Project Proposal

## Project overview 

## Data source
For this project we fetch and grabbed the data from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** our data set were retrived form **[Kaggle Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bansodesandeep/credit-card-default-prediction/notebook)**

## Data Cleanup and Analysis
### Exploration and clean up


### Analysis

## Results


Facts of the best model chosen --> a Random Forest with oversampler

1. Precision of 0 (non-default credits) is 0.85: Out of all instances predicted as non-default credits, 85% are actually non-default credits.
2. Precision of 1 (default credits) is 0.61: Out of all instances predicted as default credits, 61% are actually default credits.
3. Recall of 0 (non-default credits) is 0.92: The model correctly identifies 92% of the non-default credits out of all actual non-default credits.
4. Recall of 1 (default credits) is 0.45: The model correctly identifies 45% of the default credits out of all actual default credits.
5. Accuracy Score is 0.8132: The model predicts the correct credit status (default or non-default) for approximately 81.32% of the instances.

This model "a Random Forest with oversampler" get the best results, because the overall performance improved, and the precision of the default credits has increased to 0.61.

The visualization incluyes important facts:

Dashboard 1: Likelihood of defaulting by age group and credit limit

## Conclusions

Based on ML model, we are able to determine

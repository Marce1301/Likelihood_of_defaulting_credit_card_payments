## Data source


Original data was taken from this link:


**[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** our data set were retrived form **[Kaggle Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bansodesandeep/credit-card-default-prediction/notebook)**


We got the data into a CSV file and an MS Excel file (XLSX format)
More than 29,000 rows.

## Data loaded in a MySQL Database in AWS iCloud


In order to have the data available, we uploaded in a MySQL BD.
To have more information about this process, go README file in BD folder.

unfortunately, this task never ended (it was taking so much time that we had to break the process)

Having said that, considering the results the best is Randon Forest with oversampler model.

## Second migration try

We used a Python program to load the data.
See the code in this link:

It took almost 3 hours to finish.

## Confirmation of data into de iCloud BD

As you can see in the next picture, now the data is in the table and could be accesible from Google Colab and Tableau.
